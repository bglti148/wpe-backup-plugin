## Security

- When the plugin is deactivated, all stored API credentials are automatically deleted from the database for enhanced security.
- API credentials (User ID and Password) are encrypted before being stored in the database.
- Encryption is performed using WordPress's built-in `wp_encrypt_data()` function, which utilizes the site's unique salt keys for added security.
- Decryption occurs only when needed for API calls, using the corresponding `wp_decrypt_data()` function.
- When the plugin is deactivated, all stored API credentials are automatically deleted from the database.



## Frequently Asked Questions
