## WPE Backup Plugin

## Description

WPE Backup Plugin is a WordPress plugin that allows you to trigger WP Engine backups directly from your WordPress dashboard. This plugin simplifies the process of creating backups for your WP Engine hosted website, eliminating the need to log into the WP Engine User Portal to create a manual backup.

## Architecture

- `wpe-backup-plugin.php`: Main plugin file that initializes the plugin and sets up necessary hooks.
- `includes/class-api-handler.php`: Handles all communication with the WP Engine API.
- `includes/class-admin-page.php`: Manages the admin interface, including rendering and processing forms.
- `includes/class-backup-manager.php`: Handles the core backup creation functionality.

## Features

- Seamless integration with the WP Engine API
- Create backups with custom descriptions directly from your WordPress admin area
- Automatic detection of your WP Engine install ID
- Secure storage of API credentials
- Email notifications for backup completion

## Requirements

- WordPress 5.0 or higher
- PHP 7.0 or higher
- A WP Engine hosting account
- WP Engine API credentials

## Installation

1. Download the plugin zip file or clone the repository.
2. Upload the `wpe-backup-plugin` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory of your WordPress installation.
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

## Configuration

1. After activation, go to the 'WPE Backups' menu in your WordPress admin panel.
2. Enter your WP Engine API User ID and Password in the provided fields.
3. Click 'Save Credentials' to store your API information securely.

## Usage

### Creating a Backup

1. Navigate to the 'WPE Backups' page in your WordPress admin panel.
2. Enter a description for your backup.
3. Provide an email address for backup notifications.
4. Click 'Create Backup' to initiate the backup process.
5. Wait for confirmation email that backup is complete.

## Security

- When the plugin is deactivated, all stored API credentials are automatically deleted from the database for enhanced security.
- API credentials (User ID and Password) are encrypted before being stored in the database.
- Encryption is performed using WordPress's built-in `wp_encrypt_data()` function, which utilizes the site's unique salt keys for added security.
- Decryption occurs only when needed for API calls, using the corresponding `wp_decrypt_data()` function.
- When the plugin is deactivated, all stored API credentials are automatically deleted from the database.

## Rate Limiting

To prevent excessive API usage and ensure system stability, the plugin implements a rate limit on backup creation:

- Users can only create one backup every 30 minutes.
- If a user attempts to create a backup before the 30-minute cooldown period has elapsed, they will see an error message.
- The admin page displays the remaining time until the next backup can be created.

This rate limiting helps protect both your WordPress site and the WP Engine API from potential overuse or abuse.
